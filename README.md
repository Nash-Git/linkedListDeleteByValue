# linkedListDeleteByValue
@author: Asif Nashiry

This program deletes a node from a linked list.

This program searches the linked list for a given value. The search function, findLocTarget(self, target), will return the 
location of the value to be deleted. If the value to be deleted does not appear in the list, this function will return None.

If the value appears in the linked list, this program deletes the first occurrence of the value from the list, shows the list
after deleting the node, displays the number of elements in the list.
